- At first, a user writes his/her To-Do point in the input feild
- Then, the user clicks on the plus button that will show the To-do point in the result container
- A user could edit through the Edit button: if a user clicks on the Edit button, it will show the value in the input feild and it will show a new button called 'done'. after editing the value and clicking on the done button, the 'done' buttton will disappear, and the value will get updated.
